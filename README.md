# Stream Setup on Linux

My setup for livestream & all creator software. I use OBS on [Arch Linux](https://github.com/drewroberts/linux) with GoXLR for audio on Shure SM7B mic & multiple computers sharing video/audio through Black Magic Atem Mini Pro & Atem Mini. I also have the large and the 15 button Elgato Stream Decks hooked to the 2 main desktops (one has OBS & the other uses Streamyard & the Elgato Prompter).
